# spiking_neural_networks

This repo exist for 2 main reasons, study jax lib and its fundamentals and to start my studies on bioinspired computing systems currently throught the lenses of Deep Learning.

Other bioinspired things that are of my interest are Compliant mechanisms which Ive already designed some on the past years and I have other interests on the subject but these are the ones I can work with.

Currently this repo only possess a rather simplistic implementatation on predicting a sine wave using SNNs, in a later stage of this project I aim to port these tests onto robotic systems, and possibly analyze the capabilities of generalization of this architecture on rapidly changing enviroments such as crowded spaces or maybe even playing some games.
